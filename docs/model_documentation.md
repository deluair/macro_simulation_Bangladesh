- Policy framework
- Social factors
- NGO activities
- Political stability

#### State Variables:
- `governance_effectiveness_index`: Overall governance effectiveness
- `social_progress_index`: Social development indicator
- `policy_responsiveness`: Policy implementation effectiveness
- `institutional_quality`: Institutional quality measure
