# Bangladesh Development Simulation

A comprehensive simulation model for analyzing and projecting development trends in Bangladesh across economic, demographic, environmental, infrastructure, and governance dimensions.

## Overview

This project implements a multi-system simulation model for Bangladesh's development trajectory. The model integrates five interconnected systems to capture the complex interactions between different aspects of development.

## Key Features

- **Integrated Systems Model**: Combines economic, demographic, environmental, infrastructure, and governance systems
- **Geographic Analysis**: Spatial visualizations to highlight regional development patterns
- **Data-driven Approach**: Based on historical trends and empirical relationships
- **Scenario Testing**: Ability to test various policy interventions and development pathways
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Generates detailed HTML reports with visualizations and key metrics

## Repository Structure

- `models/`: Core simulation model components
- `utils/`: Utility functions including the HTML report generator
- `visualization/`: Visualization tools and geographic mapping functionality
- `config/`: Configuration settings for simulations
- `data/`: Input data for the simulation models
- `results/`: Output directory for simulation results and reports

## Getting Started

1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run a simulation:
   ```
   python run_simulation.py
   ```

3. View the generated HTML report in the `results/[simulation_id]/` directory
